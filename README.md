# assignment3_dl
In this assignment we basically try to predict the translated word from one language to another language. So baically this is called as transliteration in more technoncal terms. Here we used a dataset set **(aksharantar)** 


# Description about the model that we have designed.
Here for this assignment convertion from the language that we selected is the from "English" to "telugu" from the dataset **akshantar**.
To reach the final goal that is to predict the data or transliteration of the given input language to other language, we will design the Recurrent Neural Network(**RNN**) Model and also implemented the varients of the this Recurrent Neural Network like the Long - Short Term memory and Gated Recurrent networks.

# Attention and without Attention
We have added here the two different kinds of classes for the Decoder that which will consider the Attention in one and other without attention and the classes are like **attention_add_decoder** attention added decoder and **Decoder** for without attention.
